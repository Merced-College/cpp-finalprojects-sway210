The rain thundered around them as the ambush became chaos. Elias fought with wild, desperate fury, but C.A.T. Investigations stood beside him.

Claire: “Elias! Stop fighting us—we can help you.”

Elias’s eyes blazed with shock. “Help me? You protect them!”

Claire: “Not anymore.”

Razor’s voice cut through the rain. “Traitors! Kill them!”

Guns roared. Razor’s men surged forward, but Asper was a wall—disarming one, slamming another into the mud. Tom’s shots cracked through the mist, forcing them back.

Elias moved like a ghost, cutting through the chaos. He reached Razor—his blade slicing through the gang leader’s cybernetic arm.

Razor: “You think you can stop me?”

Elias: “I already have.”

But Razor drew a hidden pistol, aiming for Elias. Claire’s gun roared—one perfect shot. Razor collapsed, his weapon falling from his lifeless fingers.

The remaining gang members scattered, shadows fleeing into the rain. Elias stood, chest heaving, his knife dripping rainwater and blood.

Elias: “You… you chose justice?”

Claire: “We chose to end this.”

Elias’s rage burned out, leaving only exhaustion. He dropped the knife, rain pooling at his feet.

Tom: “You can’t undo what you’ve done. But you can stop.”

Elias looked at the knife, then at them. “Maybe… maybe there’s still a way back.”
