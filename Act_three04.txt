He stepped forward, the knife catching the faint glow from the rain-soaked window.

Claire: “Elias, you don’t have to do this. We can stop this.”

Elias: “Stop it? No. I end it. You just don’t see it yet.”

Suddenly, the hallway lights flickered—pale, sickly yellow. Shadows twisted across the walls, and the rain seemed to hammer harder against the shattered glass.

Elias: “They told me to clean up their messes. They made me a ghost. But now the ghost has a voice.”

His voice rose, a raw, desperate fury.

Elias: “They thought they could bury me. But I’m still here. I’m the shadow that never fades.”

Elias lunged, his knife flashing, silver and rain blending into a streak of death.

Tom: “Claire, look out!”

The hallway erupted into chaos. Claire twisted aside, the blade slicing the mist where she’d stood.

Elias: “You protect them! The monsters in suits! But you’re just like them—shadows hiding behind a badge.”

Claire: “We protect people, Elias! Even from you!”

Elias: “Protect them? They made this city a graveyard. And you… you protect the tomb robbers.”

Elias slashed again, his wild eyes locked on Claire. Rain streamed down his face, washing through the hollow lines of grief twisted to rage.

But his movements were not just wild—they were precise, a killer’s instinct twisted by madness.

Apser’s voice rumbled from the darkness: “Claire, keep him focused. I can get behind him.”

Tom: “Stay sharp. He’s not just desperate—he’s trained.”

Elias’s voice was a whisper, almost a growl. “Trained? I was their cleaner. I erased their sins. But they left me to rot.”

His blade lashed out, sparks flying as it scraped the rusted wall.

Elias: “And now I’m the ghost they can’t forget.”

—The Fight Intensifies—
The rain hammered against the shattered windows, a relentless hiss. Thunder rumbled somewhere beyond the mist, and the pale, flickering light bathed the hallway in a sickly glow.

Elias moved like a shadow—a blur of wet cloth, a silver edge slicing through the darkness.

Claire: “Elias, it doesn’t have to be this way!”

Elias: “It was always this way. A city of darkness… and now you drown in it.”

He lunged again, his knife sweeping out in a brutal arc. Claire dodged, the blade missing her by inches.

Tom: “He’s too fast! Claire, we need to—”

Elias: “Fast? No. I’m already dead. I’m just not done yet.”

But as the fight raged, something shifted in his voice—rage twisted into a desperate, broken cry.

Elias: “They promised me. They promised I’d be safe. But they lied. And they laughed. And now they bleed.”

Apser: “Claire, push him back! I’ve got a shot!”

Claire: “Elias, don’t make us do this!”

Elias: “Do it. Kill me. Bury me like they tried to. But the ghost doesn’t die.”

His wild swings faltered, but his gaze was sharp, his body still a storm of fury. Blood trickled from his knuckles, rain smeared across his gaunt cheeks.

Elias: “You think you can save them? You think this city can be saved?”

Claire: “Not if we become monsters like them.”

For a moment, something flickered in Elias’s hollow eyes—doubt, fear, something buried beneath the rage.

But it was gone in an instant. His knife shot forward again, rain and silver cutting through the darkness.

Elias: “Then die as heroes. Forgotten in the Rain
