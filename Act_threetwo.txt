The rain roared as the alley became a battleground. Elias darted between gang members, his blade a blur. But C.A.T. Investigations moved with deadly precision.

Claire: “Elias, stop! You don’t have to do this!”

Elias: “They’re killers! And you stand with them!”

Tom: “We stand with the living.”

Elias lunged at Claire, but Apser caught his wrist—twisting, forcing him back. Tom’s gun fired, a shot grazing Elias’s shoulder.

Razor: “Finish it!”

Claire raised her weapon. Bang.

Elias staggered, clutching his chest, his blood mixing with the rain. He sank to his knees, his voice a fading whisper.

Elias: “You… you chose them. You’re just shadows in suits.”

Razor stepped forward, kicking Elias’s lifeless body. “Another ghost in the rain.”

The gang regrouped, their weapons lowered. Razor’s cruel smile twisted.

Razor: “See? That’s power. And you’re part of it now.”

C.A.T. Investigations stood among the gang—survivors, but at what cost?
