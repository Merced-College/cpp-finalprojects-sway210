--- Epilogue: Nebcity’s Shadows ---

The rain fell heavier now, drowning the neon lights in silver streaks. Nebcity stretched out in the darkness, a city of sharp edges and hidden wounds.

Claire stood under the flickering streetlamp, her coat soaked through, watching the rain carve rivers through the alleys. Tom and Apser stood beside her — silent, like shadows.

Elias was gone. Whether he was arrested, saved, or killed — his story was over. But the scars he left behind remained.

If the player convinced Elias to surrender:
- Claire: "He was just a man. Broken, but not a monster. But will the city remember that?"

If the player fought and killed Elias:
- Claire: "In the end, we became part of the darkness. We stopped him… but did we save anyone?"

If the player helped Razor:
- Tom: "We chose survival over justice. We protected killers, and now we have to live with that."

If the player betrayed Razor:
- Apser: "We tried to play both sides. In this city, you can’t be both hero and monster."

Nebcity’s rain washed the blood from the streets, but it could not wash away the shadows.

Claire lit a cigarette, the smoke curling around her face.

Claire: "Maybe that’s all we do here — fight shadows with shadows. Maybe we never change anything."

But even as the rain fell, a faint light broke through the clouds, a fragile beam cutting through the darkness.

Tom: "Or maybe… maybe we just have to keep trying."

And in the city of shadows, the three walked away — investigators, hunters, survivors — leaving their footprints in the rain.
