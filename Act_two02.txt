The rain didn’t ease as they arrived at Club Crimson, the Red Hands’ stronghold. Neon red light pulsed through the mist, a bleeding handprint against the darkness.

Bouncers with crimson hand tattoos watched them with cold eyes, but one stepped aside. “Razor’s expecting you.”

Inside, the club was a world of shadows and pulsing lights. Razor leaned against the bar, his silver cybernetic arm tapping a glass in slow, deliberate rhythm.

Razor: “So. C.A.T. Investigations. Finally decided to stop poking around in the dark.”

Claire: “We’re here because your men are dying. And we want to know why.”

Razor’s smile was thin, his sharp eyes never leaving them. “My men are dying because of him. The killer. But you already know that.”

Tom: “And you want us to protect your gang while you sit back?”

Razor: “Not just protect. Stand with us. We hunt him, we kill him. You save my men, and I’ll make sure Nebcity remembers your names.”

Apser: “So we become your enforcers?”

Razor leaned forward, his silver fingers tapping against his glass. “Or you become heroes who stopped a killer. Depends how you spin it.”

The rain drummed against the windows. But then, a faint shiver of movement outside—shadows shifting in the mist.

Claire: “He’s watching us.”

Razor: “Good. Let him watch. It’ll make killing him easier.”



<<PAUSE>>

—The Ambush Begins—
Razor’s gang spread through the rain-soaked alleys, weapons drawn, their faces tense. C.A.T. Investigations stood with them, caught in a brutal alliance.

Tom: “This isn’t justice. This is a hunt.”

Claire: “We didn’t choose justice. We chose survival.”

A shadow moved. The mist thickened. Then—chaos.

Elias surged from the darkness, his hooded figure a blur of fury. He struck with precision—gang members fell, their screams swallowed by the rain.

Elias: “They took everything! They built their empire on blood!”
