—Convincing Elias to Surrender—
Rain whispered against the shattered windows of the abandoned building. Water pooled beneath the broken glass, shimmering like tears in the gloom.

Elias stood there, a shadow in the flickering light, his hollow eyes burning with grief. His rain-soaked coat clung to his thin frame, and his grip on the knife trembled.

Claire: “Elias, I know your pain. I know what it’s like to lose everything.”

Elias’s fingers tightened around the knife, his voice a ragged whisper.

Elias: “She was all I had… they took her. Used her. Left her to die. And I couldn’t stop them.”

Claire stepped closer, her voice a quiet, steady thread in the storm.

Claire: “And you think this will bring her back? These killings… are they her justice, or just your vengeance?”

Elias’s gaze faltered. His rage flickered—cracks in the mask of fury, revealing something fragile beneath.

Elias: “They deserve to suffer. To feel the emptiness I feel.”

Tom stepped forward, his hands open, his voice calm but unyielding.

Tom: “I get it, Elias. You’re drowning. But becoming another shadow won’t bring her back.”

The knife slipped from Elias’s fingers, striking the cold, wet floor with a sharp, echoing clang. His knees buckled, and he collapsed, his hands covering his face.

Elias: “I just… I just wanted her back. I wanted them to pay.”

Claire moved closer, kneeling beside him, her touch light but firm on his shoulder.

Claire: “You loved her. But in your pain, you became someone she wouldn’t recognize.”

Elias looked up, rain and tears streaking his gaunt face, his voice cracking like shattered glass.

Elias: “Can you save me? Or… is it too late?”

Claire’s voice softened, a gentle whisper that cut through the rain.

Claire: “It’s never too late.”

Outside, the rain fell harder, its cold fingers washing away the darkness, the blood, and the tears. And in the shadow of Nebcity, Elias Carter was no longer a monster—just a broken man, finally free of the weight of his own grief.
