Nebcity was a city of shadows—rain-slick streets and neon lights bleeding color into the mist. But lately, those shadows felt sharper. Darker.

C.A.T. Investigations—led by Claire, Tom, and Asper—had been tracking a series of brutal killings in the Underlight District. Each victim was a known member of the Red Hands Gang—a violent criminal organization with its fingers in everything from smuggling to human trafficking.

Claire leaned over the crime board, her fingers tracing the map. Red markers dotted the city, each one a body. “All the victims are connected to the gang’s trafficking network. Our killer isn’t just targeting random members—he’s hunting specific ones.”

Tom rubbed his temples, flipping through the crumpled witness reports. “No one’s talking. The gang is terrified. They don’t even know who’s next.”

Asper stood by the window, watching the rain stream down the glass. Her voice was quiet, almost lost in the storm outside. “Maybe we’re looking at this the wrong way. Maybe this isn’t just gang warfare. Maybe it’s personal.”

A sudden knock broke the tension. Claire turned. An envelope had been slid under the office door.

Her fingers trembled slightly as she tore it open. Inside was a photograph—old, crumpled, faded. A woman, smiling warmly, standing next to one of the dead gang members.

Tom leaned in, his eyes narrowing. “That’s… that’s the victim’s wife. But she’s—”

Claire: “She’s dead.” Her voice was a whisper, cold and distant. “And she’s the killer’s wife.”

Asper’s voice was a low growl. “He’s not just getting revenge. He’s making them pay.”

The rain outside seemed to intensify, hammering against the window. And for the first time, Claire felt a chill—not just from the storm, but from the feeling that they weren’t just hunting a killer.

They were being hunted.
