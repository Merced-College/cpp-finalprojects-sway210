Nebcity had always been a city of shadows, but lately, those shadows felt sharper. The rain fell like needles, turning the neon lights into rivers of color that washed the streets.

C.A.T. Investigations—led by Claire, Tom, and Apser—had been tracking a series of brutal killings in the Underlight District. Victims were found with vicious wounds, left to die alone in the cold alleys. 

But these weren’t random murders. Each victim was a known member of the Red Hands gang—a group with a reputation for violence. Most believed it was just gang warfare, a bloody struggle for territory. But Claire saw something else.

“This isn’t just territory or revenge,” Claire whispered, staring at the latest victim. Her voice was steady, but her eyes were searching. “This is personal.”

Tom adjusted his glasses, his keen eyes scanning the scene. “Every victim is connected to the Red Hands. Someone is hunting them.”

Apser crouched by the body, tracing the fresh blood with a gloved finger. “But why? What’s the motive?”

A cold wind swept the alley, and the city seemed to shudder. As they dug deeper, a chilling truth began to surface. The killer wasn’t just a murderer. He was a man who had lost everything to the gang—a husband who watched the Red Hands take his wife. And now, in his twisted view of justice, he was making them suffer.

Nebcity’s shadows were never empty. But tonight, they were alive with vengeance.

And C.A.T. Investigations was the only thing standing between the killer and his revenge.
