Nebcity’s rain fell like a curtain, a gray mist swallowing the Underlight District. The city’s neon lights blurred, drowning in the downpour. C.A.T. Investigations was stretched thin. Every lead seemed to splinter, but the bodies kept showing up—each one a known member of the Red Hands gang.

Claire leaned over the crime board, her fingers tracing the map. Red markers dotted the city, each one a body, each one a name. “All the victims are connected to the gang’s trafficking network. Our killer isn’t just targeting random members—he’s hunting specific ones.”

Tom rubbed his temples, flipping through the crumpled witness reports. “No one’s talking. The gang is terrified. They don’t even know who’s next.”

Apser stood by the window, watching the rain stream down the glass. His voice was quiet, almost lost in the storm outside. “Maybe we’re looking at this the wrong way. Maybe this isn’t a gang war. Maybe it’s personal.”

A sudden knock broke the tension. Claire turned. An envelope had been slid under the office door. 

Cautiously, she picked it up. Her fingers trembled slightly as she tore it open. Inside was a photograph—old, crumpled, faded. A woman, smiling warmly, standing next to one of the dead gang members.

Tom leaned in, his eyes narrowing. “That’s… that’s the victim’s wife. But she’s—”

“She’s dead,” Claire whispered. Her voice was cold, distant. “And she’s the killer’s wife.”

Apser’s voice was a low growl. “He’s not just getting revenge. He’s making them pay.”

The team now had a face. But as they followed the trail, they weren’t just hunting a killer—they were chasing a ghost, a man turned monster by grief.

But with every step they took, they knew—he was watching them too.
