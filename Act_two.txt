Nebcity’s rain fell like a curtain, a gray mist swallowing the Underlight District. Neon lights blurred, drowning in the downpour.

The bodies kept showing up—each one a known member of the Red Hands Gang. But as the death toll rose, so did the fear.

Claire leaned over the crime board, red markers spreading across the map like a bloody web. “This isn’t random. He’s following a pattern.”

Tom adjusted his glasses, scrolling through police reports. “But the gang won’t talk. They’re too scared.”

Asper: “If we can’t get them to talk, we’re chasing a ghost.”

A loud knock shattered the tense silence. Claire’s hand instinctively moved to her concealed holster.

Tom opened the door, and a soaked, shivering man stumbled inside—a young gang member, the Red Hand tattoo barely visible beneath his drenched sleeve. His face was pale, his eyes wild.

Gang Member: “Y-You’re the detectives, right? C.A.T. Investigations?”

Claire: “Who are you?”

Gang Member: “Name’s Nico. I… I need help. He’s killing us. He’s coming for all of us.”

Asper: “The killer. You know something?”

Nico nodded, his hands shaking. “They say he’s just a shadow, but I saw him. A hooded figure. He butchered Marco right in front of me. He said… he said her name. Lila.”

Tom’s eyes widened. “Lila… that’s the name from the photograph.”

Claire: “Why come to us?”

Nico looked over his shoulder, as if expecting a shadow to leap from the rain. “Razor. My boss. He wants to talk to you. Said you’re poking around and maybe you’re the only ones who can stop this.”

Tom frowned. “Razor? The leader of the Red Hands?”

Nico nodded. “If you want to stop the bodies from piling up, you’ll need his help. But if you’re going… you better be careful. He’s not a patient man.”

The rain continued to pour, a relentless hiss against the glass. Two leads. Two paths. But only one choice.
