---Act 2---

Rain lashed against the city as C.A.T. Investigations followed the only lead they had—the hooded figure. A shadow always seen, never caught.

Tom: “He’s not hiding. He’s hunting.”

Claire: “Then we become the hunters.”

They traced the murders—each one a brutal execution. But the pattern spiraled inward, tightening around an old, decaying apartment block—rotting walls, shattered windows, a ghost of a building left to die in the rain.

Apser: “If he’s here, he knows we’re coming.”

They stepped inside, flashlights cutting through the darkness. The air was damp, thick with rot. Claire’s pulse quickened.

A flicker of movement. A shadow at the end of the hallway.

A figure stepped forward, his face hidden beneath a soaked hood.

Claire: “Stop! We know who you are!”

The figure turned slowly, the hood sliding back.

Elias Carter—hollow eyes, rainwater tracing lines down his gaunt cheeks. A face twisted by grief, by rage, by loss.

Elias: “You shouldn’t have come.”

Tom: “Elias, we know why you’re doing this. But this won’t bring her back.”

Elias’s hand emerged—a long, blood-stained knife.

Elias: “They laughed while she died. And now they scream. That’s justice.”
